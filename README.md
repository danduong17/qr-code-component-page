### What I learned

This challenge has helped me to review basic HTML and CSS. During the challenge, I practiced to implement the given design and make a responsive page for both desktop and mobile view. 

<!-- To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

In the future, I want to improve the responsiveness of this page better. Instead of designing the desktop view first, I would try to code for mobile as this will make the page display faster on smaller devices. Besides, frameworks such as Bootstrap or React library could be also implemented for practice.


### Useful resources

- [Responsive Web Design, Media Queries](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - This helped me to create a responsive page for many devices. I really liked examples and tips mentioned there and will use it going forward.
- [Media Query CSS](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/media-query-css-example-max-and-min-screen-width-for-mobile-responsive-design/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand media query more. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
